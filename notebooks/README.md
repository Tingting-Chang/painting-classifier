## Notebooks

Here you can see most of the steps we took to manipulate our data and generate predictions from them.

The directories and files worth mentioning:

- **`data_manipulation`** contains the main scripts used to manipulate the data after the web scraping process.
- **`models`** contains all the models used to generate predictions, with the exception of the neural network ones.
All such models used instead data from the painting color histograms.
- **`tests_or_obsolete`** contains the notebooks used to test a few hypotheses, some auxiliary data visualizations, as well as pieces of code that are no longer relevant.
- **`Presentation_EDA.ipynb`** contains some of the main data analysis and visualization.
