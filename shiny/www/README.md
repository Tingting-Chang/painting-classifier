# Introduction

Why Ink Scrapers? We believe lots of people like arts or colorful pictures. Paintings are valuable data in the world. In our project, we used HSV color histogram from paintings as input to predict authors, art movements.


Using 200K paintings as our input data, applying Neural Network and machine learning algorithms to learn from images and predict the painters. 

Business insight: We used Kmeans to find out the simmilarities between paintings. The first advantage of our project is to improve efficiency.

Since lots of paintings have missing labels such as date, author, art movement, etc., our machine learning models would narrow down the scope of identifying paintings' real information so that we can help people who work in the art industry to restore the historical information about paintings. Moreover, our machine learning models are doing a very good job in finding the similar color style of paintings so that we can recommend users other paintings they maybe like. In addition, since we put weight and height ratio as one of the input data, our Kmeans model would helps us pick the paintings with the same shape. In the perspective of marketing, recommendation system is always a hot area and we can expand our project as painting recommendation system. Also, we can develop a education game for users to guess the author. For users like us who do not know much about arts, our project could be a good education tool to allow a new user to learn how to identify color style of different authors, different art movements. 

I am intereste in joining your macine learning department, because that's my feild of experties.
